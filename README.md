I have come across countless CapMetro bikes around my campus as a resident here at UT Austin. 
Out of curiosity, I have wondered how often these bikes are being used. This question led
me to factors that may influence bike usage, such as time of the day and if it is the weekened
or not. Predicting the demand for bikes at a station during a specific time could privide valuable
insight for the allocation of these bikes. Using what I have learned through self-studying of machine
learning techniques, I sought to develop a model that could accurately provide such predictions.</br></br>

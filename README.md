**Inspiration**</br>
I have come across countless CapMetro bikes around my campus as a resident here at UT Austin. 
Out of curiosity, I have wondered how often these bikes are being used. This question led
me to factors that may influence bike usage, such as time of the day and if it is the weekened
or not.
